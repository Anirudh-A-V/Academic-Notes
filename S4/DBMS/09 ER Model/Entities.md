# Entity

The basic concept that the ER model represents is an **entity**, which is a thing or object in the real world with an independent existence.

An entity may be an **object with a physical existence** (for example, a particular person, car, house, or employee) or it may be an **object with a conceptual existence** (for instance, a company, a job, or a university course).

Each entity has [[Attributes]]â€”the particular properties that describe it.

## Entity Type
An **entity type** defines a collection (or set) of entities that have the same attributes.

The collection of all entities of a particular entity type in the database at any point in time is called an **entity set** or entity collection.
