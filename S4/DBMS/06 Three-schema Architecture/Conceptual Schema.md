# Conceptual Schema

It describes the **structure of the whole database** for a community of users.

It hides details of physical storage structures and concentrates on describing
entities, data types, relationships, user operations, and constraints.

Usually, [[Representational Data Models]] are used to describe the conceptual
schema when a database system is implemented.
