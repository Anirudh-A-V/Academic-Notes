# Support of Multiple Views of the Data

A **view** may be a subset of the database or it may contain virtual data that
is derived from the database files but is not explicitly stored.

A multiuser DBMS whose users have a variety of distinct applications
must provide facilities for defining multiple views.

For example, 
one user of the database may be interested only in accessing and printing
the transcript of each student;
A second user, who is interested only in checking that students have
taken all the prerequisites of each course for which the student registers.
