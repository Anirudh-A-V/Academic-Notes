# DataBase Management System (DBMS)
A DBMS is a computerized system that enables users to create and maintain a database.

The DBMS is a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of
		- defining,
		- constructing, 
		- manipulating, and 
		- sharing databases among various users and applications.

Defining a database involves specifying the data types, structures, and constraints of the data to be stored in the database.

#### Meta-data
The database definition or descriptive information is also stored by the DBMS in the form of a database catalog or dictionary. It is called meta-data.

### Query
An application program accesses the database by sending queries or requests for
data to the DBMS.
A query typically causes some data to be retrieved; a transaction may cause
some data to be read and some data to be written into the database.

The most commonly used Query languege is [[SQL]]
