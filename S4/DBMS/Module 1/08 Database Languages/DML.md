# Data Manipulation Language

Once the database schemas are compiled and the database is populated with data, users must have some means to manipulate the database.

Typical manipulations include 
			- retrieval, 
			- insertion, 
			- deletion, and 
			- modification of the data.

The DBMS provides a set of operations or a language called the **data manipulation language (DML)** for these purposes.

In current DBMSs, the preceding types of languages are usually not considered distinct languages; rather, a comprehensive integrated language is used that includes constructs for conceptual schema definition, view definition, and data manipulation.

A typical example of a comprehensive database language is the [[SQL]] relational database language, which represents a combination of DDL, VDL, and DML, as well as statements for constraint specification, schema evolution, and many other features.

There aare two types of DML
	- [[Procedural DML]]
	- [[Non-procedural DML]]
