# Procedural DML

A **low-level or procedural DML** must be embedded in a general-purpose programming language.

This type of DML typically retrieves individual records or objects from the database and processes each separately.

Therefore, it needs to use programming language constructs, such as looping, to retrieve and process each record from a set of records.

Low-level DMLs are also called **record-at-a-time** DMLs because of this property.
