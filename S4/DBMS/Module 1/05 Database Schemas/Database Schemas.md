# Database Schemas

In a data model, it is important to distinguish between the description of
the database and the database itself.

The description of a database is called the database schema, which is
specified during database design and is not expected to change
frequently.

Most data models have certain conventions for displaying schemas as
diagrams. A displayed schema is called a **schema diagram**.

The diagram displays the structure of each record type but not the actual
instances of records.

We call each object in the schema—such as STUDENT or COURSE —a
**schema construct**.,.
