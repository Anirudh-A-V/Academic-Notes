# Representational Data Models

**Representational or implementation data models** are the models used
most frequently in traditional commercial DBMSs.

These include the widely used Relational Data Model, as well as the so called legacy data models—the network and hierarchical models—that have been widely used in the past.

Representational data models represent data by using record structures and hence are sometimes called **record-based data models**.
