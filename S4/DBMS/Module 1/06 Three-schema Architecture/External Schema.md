# External Schema

Each external schema describes the part of the database that a particular user group is interested in and hides the rest of the database from that user group.

As in the previous level([[Conceptual Schema]]), each external schema is typically implemented using a representational data model, possibly based on an external schema design in a high-level conceptual data model.
