A popular **high-level conceptual data model**. This model and its variations are frequently used for the conceptual design of database applications, and many database design tools employ its concepts.

**Enhancedâ€“ER (EER) model** - extensions to the ER model, which includes concepts such as specialization, generalization, inheritance, and union types (categories).

### Unified Modeling Language (UML) 
- Object modeling methodologies

These methodologies go beyond database design to specify detailed design of software modules and their interactions using various types of diagrams like class diagrams.
