# Contstraints

Relationship types usually have certain constraints that limit the possible combinations of entities that may participate in the corresponding relationship set.

These constraints are determined from the miniworld situation that the relationships represent.

For example, if the company has a rule that each employee must work for exactly one department, then we would like to describe this constraint in the schema.

We can distinguish two main types of binary relationship constraints:
		- [[Cardinality Ratio]]
		- [[Participation]]
