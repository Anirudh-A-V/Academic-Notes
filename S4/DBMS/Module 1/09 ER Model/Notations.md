# Notations

### Entity Types
An entity type is represented in ER diagrams as a rectangular box enclosing the entity type name.

### Attributes
Attribute names are enclosed in ovals and are attached to their entity type by straight lines.

### Composite Attributes
Composite attributes are attached to their component attributes by straight lines.

### Multivalued Attributes
Multivalued attributes are displayed in double ovals.

### Key Attributes
In ER diagrammatic notation, each key attribute has its name underlined inside the oval.

### Relationships
Relationship types are displayed as diamond-shaped boxes, which are connected by straight lines to the rectangular boxes representing the participating entity types.

### Cardinality Ratio
Cardinality ratios for binary relationships are represented on ER diagrams by displaying 1, M, and N on the diamonds appropriately.

### Participation Constraints
**Total participation** (or existence dependency) is displayed as a double line connecting the participating entity type to the relationship, whereas **partial participation** is represented by single line.

### Weak Entity Types
Both a weak entity type and its identifying relationship are distinguished by surrounding their boxes and diamonds with double lines.
The partial key attribute is underlined with a dashed or dotted line.
