# Data Definition Language

It is used by the DBA(Database Administrator) and by database designers to define both conceptual and internal schemas, in DBMSs where no strict separation of levels.

The DBMS will have a DDL compiler whose function is to process DDL
statements in order to identify descriptions of the schema constructs and to store
the schema description in the DBMS catalog.
